            <hr/>
            <div class="about">
              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                Firefeed is an application modeled after <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>,
                a site where users can post short messages, follow other users, and have their
                messages show up on a stream as soon as they are posted.
              </p>
              <p>
                So what's special about Firefeed?
                <ul>
                  <li><span class="italic">It's an entirely client side app</span>.<br/><br/>
                  This means that no special server logic is needed for its functionality.
                  Any place that can host static content, for example
                  <a target="_blank" href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> or
                  <a target="_blank" href="http://site44.com/">Site44</a>, will be able to run this app
                  by simply serving the requisite HTML, CSS and JS files.</li>

                  <li><span class="italic">The core logic is less than 500 lines of code</span>.<br/><br/>
                  Excluding the user interface, all the application logic is in two files:
                  <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/firebase/firefeed/blob/master/www/js/firefeed.js">firefeed.js</a>
                  and
                  <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/firebase/firefeed/blob/master/rules.json">rules.json</a>.
                  The former contains a thin abstraction over the data stored in Firebase, and the latter is
                  a small JSON file containing <span class="italic">all</span> the security rules that Firefeed
                  must adhere by.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                This is made possible by <a target="_blank" href="http://firebase.com">Firebase</a>,
                a scalable real-time backend with a simple JS API. All the messages posted by users
                on this site are stored there, and the API is used to update every user's web
                page with the latest messages in realtime. Firebase also supports a rules language,
                that allows the developer to enforce certain security requirements on the app.
              </p>
              <p>Sound interesting? Let's delve into the details. We'll assume you know a little
                about Firebase and how data is stored in it. Be sure to read through
                the basic documentation for Firebase if you haven't already, or take the
                quick 5-minute tutorial!
              </p>
              <hr/>
              <h3>Authentication</h3>
              <p>The very first step the user must perform in order to post a message
              on the site is to login in order to prove who they are. We use Facebook
              authenticate the user, which looks something like this:
                <img src="img/auth.png"/>
              </p>
              <p>In essence, we exchange a Facebook auth token for one from Firebase.
                This works because when we
                <a href="https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/simple-login-facebook.html">configured</a>
                our Firebase namespace, we entered our Facebook Application ID and
                secret. Thus, Firebase can be assured that the token could only have
                been produced by Firefeed, the app that the user agreed to log into.</p>
              <p>Firebase can take care of this whole process for us, so we'll
              simply import the authentication library and make a couple of function
              calls:</p>
              <pre class="prettyprint lang_js">

    var firebase = new Firebase("https://firefeed.firebaseio.com/");
    var authClient = new FirebaseAuthClient(firebase, {
      endpoint: "https://auth.firebase.com/auth"
    });
    authClient.login("facebook", function(err, token, info) {
      console.log("Got token " + token + " for user " + info.name);
    });</pre><br/>
              <p>That's it! We have now acquired a Firebase token for the user
              who just logged in and authenticated our Firebase reference with it.</p>
              <hr/>
              <h3>Security</h3>
              <p>
                Now that we have authenticated as a particular user, we'll
                need to specify some rules as to how the data must be handled by
                Firebase. This is how we ensure that our client-only app is secure.
              </p>
              <p>Before we dive into the rules themselves, it's important to note that
                the rules are tightly coupled to the data structure of your app itself.
                That's why we're doing the rules first, even before we've decided how
                we're going to store our app's data. Because all the rules are in one place,
                it's much easier to think and reason about your data!
              </p>

              <h4>Characteristics</h4>
              <p>Let's list out the basic characteristics that we want Firefeed to have (we'll call
                every message in our system a <span class="italic">spark</span>):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>All sparks are readable by anyone, even users who 
                  aren't logged in. Sparks cannot be posted without logging in.</li>
                <li>All sparks are non-mutable, so they cannot be modified, even
                  by the user that created them once they've been posted.</li>
                <li>Every user has their own list of sparks posted, and nobody should
                  be able to add to this list but the user.</li>
                <li>Every user has their own stream, which is a combined list of all
                  sparks posted by them, and by all the users that they are following.
                  No other sparks must appear in this stream.</li>
                <li>Every spark post should be attributed to the currently logged in
                  user, and users should not be able to spoof one another.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Let's translate these requirements into a set of rules! We'll have
                three top-level keys:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><code>people</code>: A list of registered users.</li>
                  <li><code>users</code>: A dictionary containing a key for
                  every user which will contain their personal data (spark list
                  and stream).</li>
                  <li><code>sparks</code>: A global list of sparks posted on
                  the site along with their metadata.</li>
                </ul>
              <h4>The Rules</h4>
              <p>Let's start off with top-level rules. Anyone can read
                everything, nobody can write to everything:
              </p>
               <pre class="prettyprint lang_js">

    {
      rules: {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": false
      }
    }</pre><br/>
              <p>
                For the list of registered users we'll have to ensure that
                only the user who is currently logged in can add an entry that
                represents themselves. Remember the authentication token
                we obtained earlier? The token also contains the user ID of the
                user to whom the token was issued, which we will refer to in our
                rules as <code>auth.id</code>:
              </p>
              <pre class="prettyprint lang_js">

    {
      people: {
        $userid: 
          ".write": $userid == auth.id
      }
    }</pre><br/>
            <p>
              The variable <code>$userid</code> refers to the key under <code>people</code>
              for which the rule is evaluated. Therefore, this rule enforces that only
              the currently logged in user can write to their own entry. Yay!
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, every user should be able to write into their own personal data
              bucket. Let's have every user bucket contain three properties:
              a list of sparks posted by them, a list of users they follow, and
              a list of users who follow them. If you're wondering why we
              chose this particular structure, hold your thought, we'll come back to
              that in a second!
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint lang_js">

    {
      users: {
        $userid: {
          ".write": $userid == auth.id,
          following: {},
          followers: {},
          stream: {}
        }
      }
    }</pre><br/>
            <p>
              Ok, so far so good. The write rule above will evaluate to true for
              the currently logged in user, and they'll be able to write to
              their data bucket. But wait, wasn't the top-level write rule
              set to false? Yes, but Firebase will allow a write even if any
              one of the write rules in the hierarchy evaluated to true. Nifty!
            </p>
            <p>
              We're not quite done yet, because other users, even those that
              the current user follows, won't be able to write the stream.
              We want to allow anyone who the user is following to be able
              to write to their stream:
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint lang_js">

    {
      stream: {
        "$sparkid": {
          ".write":
            root.child('users/' + $userid + '/following').hasChild(auth.id) &&
            root.child('sparks/' + $sparkid + '/author').val() == auth.id
        }
      }
    }</pre><br/>
            <p>Whoah! That write rule is a bit long, but let's break it down. It
              consists of two expressions that must both evaluate to true for the
              write to be allowed. It also makes use of the special <code>root</code>
              variable which points to the top-level key.
            </p>
            <p>The first rule checks if the user trying to
              write is in the <code>following</code> list of the user whose stream they're
              trying to write to. The second rule checks if the author of the spark
              being written is the same as the user who's trying to do the write.
            </p>
            <p>Great! Now let's make sure that every user in the <code>following</code>
              list is a valid user, and that anyone is able to add themselves to
              the <code>follower</code> list:
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint lang_js">

    {
      following: {
        $userid: {
          ".validate": root.child('people').hasChild($userid)
        }
      },
      followers: {
        $userid: {
          ".write": $userid == auth.id
        }
      }
    }</pre><br/>
            <p>We're almost there! We'll need to define the rules for the global
              sparks list. We need to ensure is that every spark is formatted a
              certain way, that sparks cannot be modified once posted, and that
              only the author of a spark is able to add it:
            </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint lang_js">

    {
      sparks: {
        $sparkid: {
          ".write": !data.exists(),
          ".validate": newData.hasChildren(['author', 'content']),
          author: {
            ".validate": newData.val() == auth.id
          },
          content: {
            ".validate": newData.isString()
          }
        }
      }
    }</pre><br/>
            <p>Easy! We made use of two new variables: <code>data</code> refers
            to the object currently present at that location, and <code>newData</code>
            refers to the data that will be written if the rule succeeds.</p>
            <p>Phew - we're done with the rules! The hardest part is behind us
              now, and it resulted in a small 60 line JSON file. Now Firebase
              will ensure that no data will be written where it wasn't meant to.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Application Logic</h3>

            <p>Let's come back to why we decided to structure
            the data this way. All entries in the spark list and stream for
            every user will only contain spark IDs, and the contents themselves
            will have to be fetched from the global spark list. So when a user
            posts a spark, we will simply put the content in the global list,
            and then put the ID of the spark in the stream of every user that's
            following them.</p> 

<pre class="prettyprint lang_js">

  var userid = info.id; // info is from the login() call earlier.
  var sparkRef = firebase.child("sparks").push();
  var sparkRefId = sparkRef.name();

  // Add spark to global list.
  sparkRef.set(spark);

  // Add spark ID to user's list of posted sparks.
  var currentUser = firebase.child("users").child(userid);
  currentUser.child("sparks").child(sparkRefId).set(true);

  // Add spark ID to the stream of everyone following this user.
  currentUser.child("followers").once("value", function(list) {
    list.forEach(function(follower) {
      var childRef = firebase.child("users").child(follower.name());
      childRef.child("stream").child(sparkRefId).set(true);
    });
  });
    </pre><br/>

            <p>Why do it this way? We're trading off a little bit of extra
              space for performance and scalability. This approach will
              scale well because now every user only has to
              watch their own stream to see all incoming messages:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang_js">

  var stream = firebase.child("users").child(userid).child("stream");
  stream.on("child_added", function(snapshot) {
    var sparkID = snapshot.name();
    var sparkRef = firebase.child("sparks").child(sparkID);
    sparkRef.on("value", function(spark) {
      // Render the spark into the user's feed.
    });
  });</pre>
